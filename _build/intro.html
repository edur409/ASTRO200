<h1 id="ASTROBIOLOGY-200">ASTROBIOLOGY 200<a class="anchor-link" href="#ASTROBIOLOGY-200"> </a></h1><p><strong>By KC and ED</strong></p>
<p>This book contains the topics covered in <strong>Astrobiology 200</strong> at <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">The University of Auckland</a>.  The book is broadly divided in four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PART I: THE CONTEXT FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE.</strong></li>
<li><strong>PART II: LIFE ON EARTH.</strong></li>
<li><strong>PART III: LIFE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.</strong></li>
<li><strong>PART IV: LIFE AMONGST THE STARS.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Astrobiology 200</strong> is a stage 2 paper in the <a href="http://www.env.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">School of Environment</a>. The course assumes no background in the sciences, therefore it is designed for anyone interested in <em>Astrobiology</em> with high-school level education.</p>
<h1 id="Textbook-and-Literature-for-The-Course">Textbook and Literature for The Course<a class="anchor-link" href="#Textbook-and-Literature-for-The-Course"> </a></h1><p>The main book of the course is the 4th edition of <strong><em>Life in the Universe</em></strong> by Jeffrey Bennett and Seth Shostak. Special readings will be assigned on relevant content as the course progresses.</p>
<h1 id="About-this-Book">About this Book<a class="anchor-link" href="#About-this-Book"> </a></h1><p>This book was created using the <a href="https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html">Jupyter Book</a> template. A few features of this book are:</p>
