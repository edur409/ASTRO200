Biology's Jewel: The Double Helix
====================

The word DNA is in common usage for us today as their role in the make up of genes.  That was not 
the case at the beginning of the Twentieth Century.  That DNA is the carrier of genetic information
and its peculiar structure is a scientific achievement of the post-war period after 1945.  In other 
words, nobody knew that genes were entirely composed of DNA by the time of the Second World War.

methods from crystallography, and the insightful minds of several scientists, among them the one of a 
brilliant experimental scientist called *Rosalind Franklin*.
